Name
	smsc get maxmessagelengthreducer

SYNOPSIS
	smsc get maxmessagelengthreducer

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set an integer value for max-message-length-reducer.
	The recommended value is 6. Possible values are numbers from 0 to 12. 

	Empty TC-BEGIN will be used if the message length is greater than the maximum
	possible message length minus the value specified for max-message-length-reducer.

	(message-length > max-possible-message-length - max-message-length-reducer) 

	Empty TC-BEGIN is used in MAP Version 2 and 3 for forwardSM and Mt-ForwardSM 
	requests. In MAP Version 2 the dailog portion
	(ApplicationContextName, MAPOpenInfo primitive) and the component portion 
	(forwardSM and mt-ForwardSM requests) may both together be too long to fit within 
	a MTP message. In Empty TC-BEGIN case, it first sends the dailog portion in 
	TC-BEGIN followed by the component portion in the next TC-CONTINUE. 
	Whether empty TC-BEGIN is used or not depends on the length of a message and the 
	length of SCCP addresses. This option increases the guarantee of delivery of a 
	message  to some network.
