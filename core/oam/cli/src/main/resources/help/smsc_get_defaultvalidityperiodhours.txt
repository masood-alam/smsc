SYNOPSIS
	smsc get defaultvalidityperiodhours

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to get default validity period (in hours) for 
	incoming SMSC messages that do not have their own validity period value. Validity 
	period is the time duration for which the SMSC Gateway will attempt to
	send the SMS. If the time period expires before the message can be delivered, 
	the SMSC Gateway will drop it.
